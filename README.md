# Chillara (‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡¥±) ü™ô


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Google üíª


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nikhil Biby - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Abhraham Poulose - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
We created an app that helps you share your excess student concession(ST) amounts with someone nearby you. At a bus stop, in the bus, chillara app has you covered. Dont physical money? Use any UPI app to join someone sharing. Supports android 12 to 15.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
While travelling by private bus after to and from college, we usually face the issue of either not having the right coin to pay for your Student Ticket(ST), or you may not have any physical money on you at all. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solved this by letting the people with excess amounts share their excess's with people nearby, by utilising the power of Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE). Nearby people can join the person sharing with the app. Additionally, you can join the person sharing even if you have the right amount to pay with you, thus offering a help to them.
